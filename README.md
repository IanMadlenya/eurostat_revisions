> Elected governments have incentives to stretch accounting rules. Doing so improves the government’s appearance to cost-conscious voters and fiscally important international institutions, especially in the European Union where there are externally imposed budget limits. By rule stretching we mean that when the fiscal implications of a policy are potentially ambiguous, a decision is made to minimise its affects on the public balance sheet. We expect rule stretching to be especially prevalent during periods of financial market stress and crisis given these events’ large costs and that policy responses are often not obviously classifiable as being inside or outside of the government sector. To test these propositions, we examine debt data revisions made by the European statistical agency–Eurostat. We find that debt figures are more likely to be revised upwards for countries facing European Union budget enforcement and years close to national elections, especially when unscheduled. These election effects are heightened by financial market stress. Our research underlines the importance of having a vigilant and politically independent government statistical agency to ensure reliable government finance statistics.
